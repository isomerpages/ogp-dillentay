<img src="/images/Principal%20message%20V2-min.jpg" style= "width: 70%; margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Welcome to the Yio Chu Kang Secondary School website. To students and staff new to the school, welcome to the YCKSS Family!   
We are pleased to present an updated interface and hope that this new website will give greater access to information about the School. I would like to give due credit to the school’s website development team which has worked tirelessly to make this fresh look possible. I encourage you to explore the website and discover how we create rich opportunities for our students to acquire a deeper understanding of their strengths and grow wider perspectives about our complex but wonderful world.  
  
<b>Our Story<b> and <b>Our Experiences<b> capture how vibrant school life is; how hard the staff work together to give students a chance to develop and learn; and how genuine we are to provide a nurturing and enriching experience for our students.  
  
<b>Our Curriculum <b> features all our instructional programmes where we use innovative ways to cultivate conceptual and critical thinking. Discover the interesting ways in which the various subjects come to life for our students.  

  
<b>Our Family<b> highlights our collaborations with our partners. We believe that it is only through partnerships that we can expand our capability and introduce new learning experiences to our students.  
  
Visit us often as we continue to add new content and enhance the information about <b>Our Story<b>, <b>Our Curriculum<b>, <b>Our Experiences<b>, and <b>Our Family<b>.
