	 YCKSS in COVID-19 (Special Edition for 2020) 
A very exciting and challenging year for everyone indeed! Three videos were produced to document our journey right from the start. Each video focuses on what students and staff experienced and the activities they participated in. Ever wondered how teachers taught from home or how students kept themselves healthy or how Teacher’s Day was celebrated this year? Then check out our [videos](https://yiochukangsec.moe.edu.sg/our-experience/the-horizon-newsletter) to see how things are the same yet different.
